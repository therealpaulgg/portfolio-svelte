Hey, I'm Paul Gellai. I'm a professional software engineer. I've always had a passion for tech since a young age, and it's my hobby as well as my profession. My interests include software development, cybersecurity, Linux, gaming, music, and computer hardware. During my free time I'm probably hanging out with friends or hopefully doing something fun.

I am a senior software engineer at Carvana. Love it there ðŸ™‚

If you'd like to contact me, feel free to do so at my email.
