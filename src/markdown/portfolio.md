Note: any projects I put on this page are personal/freelance projects. I do quite a bit of interesting work at my day job but this is not a space for that.

## Development Projects

- To be up to date with the current trends I like to mess around with ChatGPT and OpenAI GPT4. I have messed around with some prompt engineering and tried to get it to write unit tests.
- Built a really sweet [SSH syncing utility written in Go](https://github.com/therealpaulgg/ssh-sync). Uses secure crypto to trade keys between computers (it's super cool). Requires a client and a server.
- [Portfolio Website (haha)](https://github.com/therealpaulgg/portfolio-svelte)
- [Start Page Website, simple but very practical](https://github.com/therealpaulgg/browser-startpage-redux)
- Developing websites in React (React, React Native, Gatsby) for personal projects/freelance, as well as Svelte (what this site and my Blog are written in)
- Self-made blog made in VueJS 2 and Node.JS (has been replaced with a Svelte static site generated blog)

## IT Projects

- I recently expanded my home intranet to include a variety of different services for media consumption such as Plex. I also set up my own Certificate Authority using a Raspberry Pi as a Certificate Authority Server using [Smallstep](https://smallstep.com/cli/).
    - I created internal documentation for my intranet and also created a proper dashboard using Homer.
- Set up a [Pterodactyl](https://pterodactyl.io/) instance for hosting game servers. Great 
tool to quickly spin up & manage game server instances.
- Set up an email server for random things, utilized OpenGPG to find out how to send encrypted emails
- I host all of my applications on a [Digitalocean droplet.](https://digitalocean.com) Self managed.
- I deploy my apps using [Drone CI.](https://www.drone.io/)
- I have set up a nice home network utilizing Ubiquiti hardware, separating my main network devices from smart home devices. VLANs, VPNs, network hardening, etc.

## Misc (Technical Competency, Cybersecurity)

- I have set up & used Arch Linux before, but I have now decided it is too much effort to maintain a functional OS for personal use
- I've actively used all three main operating systems: Linux, MacOS, and Windows. Currently I'm using Windows with WSL 2, and a Fedora VM for any cybersecurity activities (like CTFs).
- I've played some CTFs with [Shellphish](https://ctftime.org/team/285/), although I'm not that good. My primary interests are web, crypto, and pwn. I also like network security.
- My fastest typing speed record is [177 wpm](https://static.paulgellai.dev/personal/typing_speed.png). My normal typing speed is realistically around 150.
